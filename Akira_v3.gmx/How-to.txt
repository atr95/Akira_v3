How to make a room:

Notify Alex that you're about to make a room.

Step 1:
	Go to the Rooms section of the editor (the folder below Objects).
	Duplicate rm_base (right click it, select duplicate).
	rename the room as "rm_(room_number)" for example, rm_2, rm_3, etc.


		rm_base is a basic version of a room that contains all the creation code that rooms need.
		By duplicating it, this ensures that the new room contains that creation code and is built at the correct resolution.

		All rooms can only be 360 pixels high. No exceptions.
		However, they can be as wide as you want. The default width is 640.  640x360 = 16x9 screen resolution.
		If you want a room wider than 640, change the width of the room to the value you want from the room edit screen.
		I suggest using widths that are in intervals of 320. that is, 640, 960, 1280, 1600, 1920, and so on.

		When you change the width of your duplicated room to a value larger than 640, 
		you'll notice that the black bars in the image
		no longer line up correctly to the with of the room.
		Select the tile tab and this will allow you to interact with the black bars.
		Move the leftmost side bar to the new end of the room.
		Then you need to deal with the bottom and top bars. They can't simply be dragged over though.
		In the tile tab is a large square. Below that is a textbox that says Undefined by default. click that.
		Select the folder "bg_tile_black_bars"
		Inside that is the tile set for the top and bottom black bars.
		Select which you need and then select the image in the square above this text box.
		You can now place the black bar where you need it in the room.
		All rooms need these black bars for consistency. 
		
		If you need a room smaller than the default, the process is different.
		Instead of change the width of the room to a smaller value than 640,
		simply add more black bars to the sides of the screen.
		Then, once finished, go to settings tab and click Creation Code.
		In this code page, change the value of 
		"global.border" to 104 + how ever thick the new border is.
		For example, if you add 1 additional side bar to the screen,
		the new value would be 104 + 64 since a side bar is 64 pixels wide.
		"global.border = 104 + 64" is an accepted statement so no need to do math.

Step 2:
	2.1
	You need Doors for your room.
	goto Objects, look for obj_interact, then inside that obj_group_doors
	Duplicate obj_door_0. rename your new door as obj_door_(door number)
	Open your new obj_door.
	Click on the create event code.
	change the statement on line 4 to have the name of your room.
	Open the code for alarm_1.
	Change line 2 to have the number in the array that matches your door.
	change line 5 and 11 for the current room.
	change line 7 and 9 for where the door goes.
	2.2
	Goto Scripts. Inside of scr_group_room_start open scr_spawn_interior.
	create a case for your room.
	write where in the room your door needs to be spawned.
		"instance_create( x value, 288, obj_door_(door_number));"
	if your room has any items, follow similar steps.
	if your room has enemies, go to scr_spawn_enemy
	2.3
	Goto scr_spawn_player.
	create a case for your room.
	create an if statement for your doors index in the array.
	create a statement setting your doors index to false.
	create a statement for spawning your player where your door is.

Step 3:
	decorate your room!
	open your room up, go to tiles. Select the tiles you wish to use.
	start placing tiles where you want them in the room.
	Then I think you're done!
	
Step 4:

	commit your room to the github.
	Tell Alex that you did so.
